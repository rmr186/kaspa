# API Server

The API Server connects to a full node, and allows connected clients to interact with the node via RESTful API calls. The API Server makes it easier for clients such as wallets and block explorers to interact with the Kaspa network. It allows sending transactions, getting an address balance, listening for updates, and querying for blocks and transactions.

You can connect to one of the community maintained API servers or you can set up your own server. Bear in mind that if you choose to set up your own API server, you will also need to connect it to a full node.

* For a list of RESTful API calls see the [API Server reference](./).
* For setting up your own server, you can either use the [API Server Docker](../running-a-node/full-node-quick-setup-with-docker.md) or [compile from source](run-an-api-server-docker-container.md).
