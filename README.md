# Welcome

Welcome to the Kaspa documentation website.

**Kaspa's mission is to create a high throughput, photonic proof-of-work, expressive, sound money.**

Kaspa is the name of the money. Kaspa Initiative is the name of the open source movement.  
Kaspa's core principles are:

* High throughput [Phantom](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/104.pdf) consensus layer, supporting one block per second and near-immediate transaction confirmations.
* Optical-proof-of-work, enabling [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)-inspired security properties, and geographically decentralized and sustainable mining and fair participation rewards.
* Decoupling of verification from mining keeping native currency lightweight, while supporting and enhancing upper-layer use cases, using EVM-inspired smart contracts without bloating the base layer.
* Open source, Bitcoin-inspired, decentralized community-governed project.
* Transparent monetary policy.
