  Kaspa and the Kaspa Initiative paragraph)? Who are these docs intended for?
  What can be found here? Quick links?

# Welcome to Kaspa

change test   This repository holds the core Golang implementation of a Kaspa - a modified PHANTOM protocol forming the world's first truly decentralized & robust value transfer using Proof of Work consensus & Staking based trustless smart contracts.

make another quick change at the end

## Kaspa Repo Structure

All the basic components needed for running a p2p transaction ledger are available in the Kaspa Core Repo on [Github](https://github.com/daglabs).  Mainly these can be categorized as follows:

* Full Node \(FN\):  Compiling kspd,go will build a Kaspa full P2P node.
* Pruned Node \(PN\): Doesn't keep archival tx info, or other node overhead.
* JSON.RPC API for node communication
* Kaspa BlockDAG server API for network data via  centralized API server
* Package Utilities: commonly used packages outlined in the next section.

## Next Steps

We highly suggest you spend a little time understanding how BlockDAGs work, how they are different then Bitcoin as well as in what way both these 'proof of work' consensus protocols really work the same.

After getting a feel for Kaspa \(and maybe reading the GhostDAG protocol's white paper\), you will most likely next start getting to know how Kaspa packages work as you start to interact with the Kaspa Devnet.
