# Kaspacoin Intro

= Bitcoin is awesome, and before starting you should know that Kaspacoin is based on Bitcoin, developed by researchers striving to stay as true as possible to Bitcoin's principles, and Kaspa's core codebase is actually a fork of a Golang implementation of Bitcoin called 'btcd'.

So, why did we make Kaspacoin? The Kaspa Network is what's called a Directed Acyclic Graph \(DAG\) of blocks, rather then a 'Chain' of blocks.

Just like Bitcoin is the currency of said's 'blockchain network', **Kaspacoin is the currency of the Kaspa blockDAG network**. Both adhere to the spirit & core of values of a truly decentralized, intermediary free, global financial networks.

However, Kaspacoin offers significant improvements over Bitcoin's protocol, such as 50x increased throughput, as well as improved privacy, functionality, & the robustness necessary for running a global decentralized financial network.

## Kaspa is a blockDAG network

Currently, we are still in the process of rolling out this new network, which in general includes the following aspects:

* Communal formalization of Kaspacoin's cryptoeconomic models.
* Core dev implementation of Kaspa's GhostDAG consensus protocol.
* Development of nodes, wallets, explorers, or other applications utilizing the Kaspa blockDAG network.
