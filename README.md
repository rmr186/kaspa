# Welcome

Welcome to the Kaspa documentation website.

**Kaspa's mission is to create a high throughput, photonic proof-of-work, expressive, sound money.**

Kaspa is solving the shortcomings of existing cryptocurrency projects. Bitcoin is very secure, but it takes a couple of hours for a transaction to be authorized, and does not allow building financial applications on top of it. It has therefore become mainly a store of value, like digital gold. We are creating a new digital money that can handle immediate transaction authorization on a global adoption scale and can efficiently be used as a railing for financial apps, while not lowering the security threshold, so it is as secure as Bitcoin and has the potential to be more secure due to higher decentralization.

Kaspa's core principles are:

* High throughput [Phantom](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/104.pdf) consensus layer, supporting one block per second and near-immediate transaction confirmations.
* Optical-proof-of-work, enabling [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)-inspired security properties, and geographically decentralized and sustainable mining and fair participation rewards.
* Decoupling of verification from mining keeping native currency lightweight, while supporting and enhancing upper-layer use cases, using EVM-inspired smart contracts without bloating the base layer.
* Open source, Bitcoin-inspired, decentralized community-governed project, called the Kaspa Initiative.
* Transparent monetary policy.
