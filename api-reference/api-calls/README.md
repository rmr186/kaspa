# API Server

Server API is a dedicated server providing a set of tools for exploring the Kaspa Ledger.  The Server API  does not currently offer all of the tools offered by our JSON-RPC API \(e.g. validation, mining functions, etc.\) 

{% hint style="info" %}
If you want to make JSON-RPC API calls using any authenticated JSON-RPC client without running a dedicated serer please check out[ the JSON-RPC API reference](../object-types/).  
{% endhint %}
