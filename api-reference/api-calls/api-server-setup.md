# API Server Setup

The API Server acts as an oracle onto the Kaspa network by by connecting to a full Kaspa node while running requests locally rather then connecting to a network node over the Internet.

Follow these instructions to setup your own Kaspa API Server:

1. Clone the Kaspa open source code from DAGlabs' Github onto the machine you want to use.
2. Install the following prerequisites:
   1. MySql
   2. Go runtime
   3. ???
3. From the command prompt, get to the directory where you have cloned Kaspa's code.
4. Start an instance of the API Server using the apiserver command.
