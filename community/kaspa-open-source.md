# Kaspa Social Contract

## Social Contract

Consensus should be optimized for sound and scalable SoV, payment, settlement, transfer of digital assets, and proof of publication.

Layer isolation.

Bitcoin like characteristics:

* Proof of work
* Abundance of full nodes
* Thin design, isolation, predictability, determinism \(read: UTXO model\)
* Fixed monetary policy
* Lack of a formal governing organization

Permissionless
