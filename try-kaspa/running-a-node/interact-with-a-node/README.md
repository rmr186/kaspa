# Interact with a Node

### Interaction Tools

After launching your node, you can interact with it by running [CLI bash commands](node-cli-interface.md), or by calling a [JSON-RPC API](node-json-rpc-api.md) from a client application.

### Work with an API Server

For querying the network or building wallet or block explorer application you will need to run an API Server to your existing node.

### Setup a Local Dev Net

Finally, you can also run multiple nodes locally \(each running on a different port\) and run a local Kaspa Dev network.  

* At least 2 nodes running \(either locally or on the network\)
* Miner simulator
* Transaction generator

You can run a miner simulator \(generating blocks\) or a transaction generator by running the appropriate commands from _**~/code/btcd/mining.**_
