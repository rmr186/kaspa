# The Kaspa Stack

\*\*\*\*[**Bitcoin**](kaspa-repo/untitled.md#bitcoin) is essentially an implementation of a [**consensus protocol**](kaspa-repo/untitled.md#consensus-protocol), which defines the rules and methods for maintaining a **distributed general ledger** using a **blockchain** network infrastructure.

\*\*\*\*[**KaspaCoin**](kaspa-repo/untitled.md#kaspacoin) is a universal [**distributed digital currency**](kaspa-repo/untitled.md#distributed-general-ledger), similar to Bitcoin, that includes a symbiotic ****[**consensus stack**](kaspa-repo/untitled.md#consensus-stack) enabling robust,[ **trustless store of value**](kaspa-repo/untitled.md#trustless-store-of-value), as well as ****stable ****[**medium of exchange**](kaspa-repo/untitled.md#medium-of-exchange) rules and derivative financial products that are 'aware' of 'real world' relationships & context ****between ****[**transactions**](kaspa-repo/untitled.md#transactions). 

This is a significant improvement over [**Ethereum**](kaspa-repo/untitled.md#ethereum) ****[**smart contracts**](kaspa-repo/untitled.md#smart-contracts), for example, which are on their own ****oblivious ****to ****[**transaction context**](kaspa-repo/untitled.md#transaction-context) without the use of[ **trusted 3rtd party**](kaspa-repo/untitled.md#trustless-store-of-value) 'oracles' and other data.  

While ingenious technological innovations in their own right, ****Ethereum's [**Turing complete**](kaspa-repo/untitled.md#turing-complete) ****architecture \(and derived protocol structure\) make it limited as a store of value, and Ethereum smart contracts much less **robust** or **scalable**, making them less then ideal for implementing complex [**'methods of exchange**](kaspa-repo/untitled.md#medium-of-exchange)**'** transactions need for complex financial products on distributed, trustless blockchains.

\*\*\*\*[**Bitcoin**](kaspa-repo/untitled.md#bitcoin), on the other hand, is ****[**non Turing complete**](kaspa-repo/untitled.md#non-turing-complete) ****by design, meaning that Bitcoin transactions have a limited lifespan - they are only valid so long as several other conditions are true \(e.g. no other transaction has rendered this current transaction invalid by spending the same unspent transaction output, etc.\)  

This is a major advantage over Ethereum smart contracts, which are not 'aware' of other transactions on the network without being expressively spelled out in the contract code or by using a trusted 3rd party such as 'oracles',etc.

However, **Bitcoin has its own limitations**, mainly its famous scalability issue - with 1 new block created every 10 minutes, and transaction verification times measured in hours and days.  Also, [Bitcoin Scripts](kaspa-repo/untitled.md#bitcoin-script), while elegant, are far less expressive then Ethereum smart contracts written in programming language such as **Solidity**, making Ethereum the richest Web 3 development ecosystem available today.

KaspaCoin leverages several advancements in [**distributed ledger**](kaspa-repo/untitled.md#distributed-general-ledger) technology to create a bitcoin-based network with the following:

* \*\*\*\*[**Proof of Work**](kaspa-repo/untitled.md#proof-of-work) consensus algorithm with 50x improvement in throughput without degradation of quality \(orphan rate\) as Bitcoin.
* Astronomically improved confirmation times \(seconds instead of hours\)
* Robust ultra-scalable smart contract layer using permission-less set of 'stakeholders' known as 'validators'.
* ... 

###   KaspaCoin's stack is comprised of the following layers:
